# Application_Tracker
MERN application to track postings of applied roles.

Visit the live site:https://applicationtrackerlive.netlify.app/

This web application was designed to save job applications as you apply to avoid being contacted by a prospective employer only to find out the position that you applied to 3 months ago is no longer posted... leaving you without specific posting details.

In addition, by adding tags and search, you can see similar positions as well as add comments regarding the post and/or progress made!
